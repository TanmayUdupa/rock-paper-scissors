# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple implementation of the game, "rock paper scissors" using Javascript in which a player plays against the computer. It is a game in which the player who scores 5 points first wins.

By doing this project, I have learnt how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript and making that happen dynamically using Event Listeners.
